===========

XOR Encrypt is a simple tool written in c++ and actionscript that can provide a fast way to safeguard your documents, making them unreadable to others. It is one of the many software solutions out there dedicated to data protection, aiming to prevent unauthorized access to private files.

As its name suggest, XOR Encrypt relies on the XOR encryption algorithm, which applies the XOR operator to each character of a text. However, note that this simple obfuscation method is dedicated for general use and should not be used with very sensitive or confidential documents.

One of the main advantages of this application is related to the variate range of supported input formats. Not only that it can encrypt plain text files, but it can also handle HTML and XML documents, source code files (CSS, C, CPP, PY) and even JPEG images.
